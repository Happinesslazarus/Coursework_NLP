Natural Language Processing – Comparative Evaluation

This repository contains a comparative evaluation of three distinct NLP pipelines applied to a text classification task. The goal is to explore how different modeling approaches perform on the same dataset, following best practices in representation learning, algorithm design, and evaluation.

Models Compared
- Logistic Regression with TF-IDF** – A simple, interpretable baseline using statistical features.
- BiLSTM with Word2Vec** – A deep learning model that captures sequential and semantic patterns.
- Fine-tuned BioBERT** – A transformer-based model pre-trained on biomedical text for contextual understanding.

Structure
- Comparative_Evaluation.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all code, analysis, and discussion.
- data: Folder containing the dataset or a link in the README if too large.
- models: Saved model files (if applicable).
- figures: Visualizations used in the evaluation.

Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and visualized to highlight strengths and weaknesses. The notebook includes both code and written analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used is publicly available and suitable for text classification. Source: [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), or [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=text-classification).

Getting Started
To run the notebook:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in the notebook.
3. Run Comparative_Evaluation.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code.

Notes
- All code is written in Python.
- Frameworks used: scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers.
- Results are reproducible and all necessary files are included or linked.
